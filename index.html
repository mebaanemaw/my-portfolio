      <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Meba Anemaw, an aspiring software engineer with a deep interest in ethical technology, continuous learning, and building solutions that make a real difference. I'm currently sharpening my skills through the ALX training program, where I’m learning not just to code, but to think critically and solve meaningful problems.

        I’m in the early stages of my journey, but I’m passionate about creating digital experiences that are thoughtful, user-focused, and impactful. As I grow, I’m exploring ideas for personal projects that reflect these values and allow me to blend creativity with technical skill.
        
        For me, software engineering is more than just a profession—it's a chance to grow every day, challenge myself, and contribute to something bigger than myself. I’m excited to keep learning, build things that matter, and become the kind of developer who brings positive change through technology.</p>
